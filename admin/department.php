This part tells the database to select three pieces of information:
department.department_id: The ID of the department.
department.department_name: The name of the department.
faculty.faculty_name AS faculty_name: The name of the faculty, with the AS faculty_name part giving it a shorter, easier-to-use name in the result.

"FROM department": This part tells the database which table to get the information fromâ€”in this case, the department table.

"LEFT JOIN faculty ON department.faculty_id = faculty.faculty_id": This part tells the database to also include information from the faculty table, matching rows where the faculty_id in the department table is the same as the faculty_id in the faculty table.

 The LEFT JOIN means that even if there is no matching faculty, the department information will still be included.
